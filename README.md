So long, `ppdire` package...
============================
...and thanks for all the fish!

The `ppdire` package has been sunset and will no longer be updated. 
Its contents have migrated into the `direpack` package: 
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/direpack/) 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/SvenSerneels/direpack)

The `ppdire` package in this final version will still stay live for a while for backwards compatibility.

How to install
--------------
The package is distributed through PyPI, so install through: 
        
        pip install ppdire 
        
Documentation
